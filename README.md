## IND320 PROJECT - PART 2


### Elhub Electricity Production Dashboard

This project visualizes hourly electricity production in Norway for 2021 using the Elhub API. The data is stored in MongoDB, processed with Spark and pandas, and displayed in an interactive Streamlit dashboard. Users can select a price area to view a pie chart of production share, and choose production group(s) and month to see hourly trends in a line chart. Data source and details are provided in the dashboard. Built with Python, Streamlit, Plotly, PyMongo, and Spark.
